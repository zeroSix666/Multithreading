# Multithreading for FiveM

Multithreading is a way to achieve parallelism in your FiveM server by splitting your code into smaller, independent tasks that can run concurrently. By doing so, you can greatly improve the performance and responsiveness of your server, especially in high-traffic situations.

## Benefits of Multithreading
Improved performance: By executing multiple tasks in parallel, multithreading can help you complete more work in less time.
Better resource utilization: Multithreading helps distribute the load across multiple cores, which can help improve resource utilization and reduce lag.
Increased responsiveness: Multithreading helps keep your server responsive, even in high-traffic situations, by handling multiple requests simultaneously.

##Implementing Multithreading in FiveM
There are several ways to implement multithreading in FiveM, but the most common is to use parallel loops. Here's an example of how to do this in Lua:


local function worker(id, input)
    -- Your code here
    -- This is the task that will be run concurrently
end

local function main()
    -- Your main code here
    local inputs = {...}
    local tasks = {}
    for i, input in ipairs(inputs) do
        tasks[i] = coroutine.create(function() worker(i, input) end)
    end

    while true do
        local has_any_running = false
        for i, task in ipairs(tasks) do
            if coroutine.status(task) == "suspended" then
                coroutine.resume(task)
                has_any_running = true
            end
        end

        if not has_any_running then
            break
        end

        Citizen.Wait(0)
    end
end

Citizen.CreateThread(main)

This code creates a set of worker tasks and runs them in parallel, with each task running in its own coroutine. The main function schedules the tasks, resuming them when necessary, and terminates when all tasks have completed.

Note that multithreading in FiveM is not as straightforward as it is in other programming languages, and there are some challenges you need to be aware of, such as synchronization and race conditions. Be sure to read the FiveM documentation and forums carefully to learn more about these issues and how to avoid them.

### Conclusion
Multithreading is an effective way to improve the performance and responsiveness of your FiveM server. By implementing multithreading in your code, you can handle more requests simultaneously and distribute the load across multiple cores, which can help reduce lag and improve resource utilization.
